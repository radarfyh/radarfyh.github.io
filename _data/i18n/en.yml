    My name is Feng Yonghua, and I lead a software development team dedicated to helping customers achieve digital transformation by providing professional, reliable, and efficient services.

    - Currently, we primarily focus on the intelligent and customized development of office automation software and customer relationship management (CRM) software. In particular, we leverage LLM (Large Language Model) agents to enhance the intelligence of these systems
    - This enables us to assist customers throughout the entire lifecycle—from design, development, and testing to delivery, operation, maintenance, and final acceptance—with dynamic tracking and optimization
