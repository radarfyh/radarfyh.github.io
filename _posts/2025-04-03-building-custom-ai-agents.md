Custom AI Agents are intelligent systems designed to perform specific tasks autonomously, combining machine learning models, business rules, and workflow automation.

## Why Build Custom AI Agents?

- **Domain Specificity** ： Pre-trained models often lack domain-specific knowledge required for specialized tasks
- **Process Integration**： Off-the-shelf solutions rarely integrate seamlessly with existing business workflows
- **Competitive Advantage** ： Custom agents can become unique differentiators in your market

   * Technical troubleshooting
   * Personalized product recommendations
   * Multilingual support

- Business Process Automation
Agents that automate multi-step workflows

   * Invoice processing
   * Regulatory compliance checks
   * Supply chain optimization

## Implementation Approach

- Development Steps
  1. **Requirement Analysis**： Identify key decision points and knowledge requirements
  2. **Data Preparation**： Curate and structure relevant datasets
  3. **Model Training**： Develop and fine-tune machine learning models
  4. **Integration**： Connect with existing systems and APIs
