## The Transformation of Business Structures, Commercial Models, and Profit Mechanisms in Traditional Industries

- Under the impact of internet technologies such as cloud computing, big data, mobile, and social media, traditional industries have undergone significant changes in their business structures, commercial models, and profit mechanisms—particularly in how enterprises interact with their customers.

- The old methods of customer engagement and management have become inefficient and outdated, leading to common challenges such as:
  - **Lack of a Scientific and Rational Sales Resource Allocation & Customer Ownership Mechanism**
    - Internal conflicts between direct sales and channel partners, or even among sales reps within the same team, due to no effective conflict resolution process
    - No unified standard for determining customer ownership, leading to multiple teams repeatedly approaching the same client, causing customer fatigue and dissatisfaction
  - **Absence of an Effective Follow-Up System, Leading to Poor Customer Retention**
    - Companies possess only basic customer data, with most deals being one-time transactions
    - Customer resources are lost when sales reps leave, and when client information is transferred across departments or product lines, new personnel struggle to pick up the thread due to missing historical details, resulting in poor user experience
  - **Low Utilization of Customer Resources**
    - No complete lifecycle data prevents companies from maximizing customer value through repeat engagement
    - Managers lack visibility into follow-up processes, leading to opaque operations and unexplained customer attrition
