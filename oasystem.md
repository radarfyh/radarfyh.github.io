### **Pain Points of Traditional Office Models**  
- **Manual workflows**: Approvals rely on paper/offline communication, leading to redundant tasks.  
- **Over-reliance on individual experience**: Inconsistent task allocation and follow-up with no standardization.  
- **Information loss**: Files stored haphazardly, causing critical data gaps during personnel changes.  
- **Inefficient management**: Decisions based on intuition rather than data, resulting in process inefficiencies.  

### **Advantages of Intelligent OA Systems**  
- **Automated workflows**: Smart approval routing reduces manual intervention, boosting efficiency by 50%+.  
- **Standardized collaboration**: Automated task assignment, reminders, and tracking to eliminate delays and oversights.  
- **Centralized knowledge management**: Unified document storage with full traceability, enabling faster onboarding.  
- **Data-driven decision-making**: Real-time dashboards identify bottlenecks for precise management adjustments.  

## **Standard OA Solution – The Digital Collaboration Trend Makes Efficient Management Possible**  
**Digital Management**: Traceable, Collaborative, Optimizable, Predictive, Decision-Ready  

The OA system evolves from a basic office tool to an intelligent, enterprise-wide management platform, covering five core modules: Administration, Human Resources, Project Management, Training, and Finance. The solution includes the following 8 key functions:
